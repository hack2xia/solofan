---

## ✨ Features

### Temperature Monitoring
- **Real-time CPU Temperature**: Accurate readings from SMC sensors (TC0P, TC0D, TC0E, TC0F)
- **GPU Temperature Tracking**: Monitor dedicated GPU thermal levels
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded indicators (green → yellow → orange → red)
- **History Tracking**: See temperature trends over time

### Fan Control
- **Manual Mode**: Set fan targets using **per-fan SMC min/max RPM** (optional separate sliders per fan)
- **Automatic Mode**: 
  - Temperature-based automatic adjustment
  - Configurable temperature thresholds
  - Adjustable aggressiveness levels (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
  - Intelligent ramping to prevent sudden speed changes
- **Multi-Fan Support**: Unified or **per-fan** manual targets; automatic mode clamps each fan to its own SMC maximum
- **Safe Fallback**: Automatic restoration of system-managed control on exit

### System Integration
- **Menu Bar Interface**: Quick access without cluttering your desktop
- **Launch at Login**: Auto-start support using modern ServiceManagement API (macOS 13+)
- **Demo Mode**: Test the interface with simulated data
- **Battery Awareness**: Monitor battery status and health (optional)
- **User Preferences**: Persistent settings stored securely

---

## 📋 Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Minimum**: **macOS 13.0+ (Ventura)** — this matches `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in `fan.xcodeproj`.
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon and Intel (CI produces a build suitable for both where applicable)

Newer-OS features are gated at runtime: native **Liquid Glass** styling and `MeshGradient` only render on **macOS 15/26+**, with material-based fallbacks on older systems (for example ServiceManagement paths that prefer **macOS 13+**).

### Permissions
- **Temperature Reading**: Works without special privileges on most Macs
- **Fan Control**: Requires root/admin access due to SMC write operations

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Pre-built Binary (Recommended)
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Move `ffan.app` to your `/Applications` folder
3. Right-click and select "Open" (first launch only, due to Gatekeeper)

### Option 2: Build from Source

#### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ffan.git
cd ffan
```

#### Build Steps
```bash
# Build with Xcode
open fan.xcodeproj
# Build using: Product → Build (⌘B)

# Or build via command line
xcodebuild -project fan.xcodeproj -scheme fan -configuration Release
```

#### Installing SMC Helper (Required for Fan Control)
```bash
cd tools/smc-helper
make
sudo ./install.sh
```

This installs the `smc-helper` binary with setuid permissions to `/usr/local/bin/`, allowing fan control without repeated password prompts.

---

## 📖 Usage

### First Launch

1. **Launch the App**: Click the ffan icon in your menu bar
2. **Permission Check**: ffan will test SMC access automatically
3. **Demo Mode**: If SMC access is restricted, enable Demo Mode to explore features

### Enabling Fan Control

#### Method 1: Using SMC Helper (Recommended)
```bash
# Install once (requires admin password)
cd tools/smc-helper
sudo ./install.sh
```

After installation, fan control will work seamlessly within the app.

#### Method 2: Running with sudo
```bash
sudo /Applications/ffan.app/Contents/MacOS/ffan
```

⚠️ **Note**: Running with sudo is not recommended for daily use due to security implications.

### Control Modes

#### Manual Mode
- **Purpose**: Direct fan speed control
- **Use Case**: When you need specific RPM for tasks (gaming, rendering, silence)
- **How to**:
  1. Toggle "Enable Fan Control"
  2. Select "Manual" mode
  3. Drag the speed slider to desired RPM

#### Automatic Mode
- **Purpose**: Temperature-responsive fan control
- **Use Case**: Automatic thermal management
- **Configuration**:
  - **Threshold Temperature**: When auto control kicks in (default: 60°C)
  - **Max Speed**: Upper RPM cap for auto mode, clamped to each fan’s SMC maximum
  - **Aggressiveness**: How quickly fans ramp up (0.0 = minimal, 1.5 = balanced, 3.0 = aggressive)

### Settings

- **Launch at Login**: Enable from the app's preferences
- **Temperature Units**: Celsius (default) or Fahrenheit
- **Refresh Rate**: Adjust polling frequency (balance between responsiveness and CPU usage)

## 🔧 SMC Implementation

### What is SMC?

The **System Management Controller** is a subsystem in Mac computers that manages:
- Thermal sensors and cooling fans
- Battery charging and power management  
- Keyboard backlighting and ambient light sensing
- System power states

### How ffan Accesses SMC

```swift
// Simplified flow
1. Open IOService connection to "AppleSMC"
2. Create SMCParamStruct with desired key (e.g., "F0Tg" for fan 0 target)
3. Send IOConnectCallStructMethod with appropriate command
4. Parse response bytes based on SMC data type (fpe2, ui16, etc.)
```

### SMC Keys Used

| Key | Description | Type | Access |
|-----|-------------|------|--------|
| `TC0P` | CPU Package Temperature | sp78 | Read |
| `TC0D` | CPU Die Temperature | sp78 | Read |
| `TG0P` | GPU Package Temperature | sp78 | Read |
| `F0Ac` | Fan 0 Actual RPM | fpe2 | Read |
| `F0Mn` | Fan 0 Minimum RPM | fpe2 | Read |
| `F0Mx` | Fan 0 Maximum RPM | fpe2 | Read |
| `F0Tg` | Fan 0 Target RPM | fpe2 | Write* |
| `FS! ` | Force Fan Mode | ui8 | Write* |

*Write operations require root privileges

### Why Root Access?

macOS kernel restricts SMC write operations to protect against:
- Thermal damage from insufficient cooling
- Hardware instability from invalid commands
- Malicious software manipulating system thermals

**ffan's solution**: A small setuid helper binary (`smc-helper`) that validates and executes only safe fan control commands.

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Setuid Binary
- **Location**: `/usr/local/bin/smc-helper`
- **Permissions**: `4755` (setuid root)
- **Validation**: Helper validates all inputs before SMC writes
- **Scope**: Limited to fan control operations only

### Best Practices
- ✅ Review `smc-helper` source code before installation
- ✅ Install from trusted sources only
- ✅ Monitor system temperatures initially to ensure safe operation
- ❌ Don't run the main app with sudo (unnecessary security risk)
- ❌ Don't set extremely low fan speeds that could cause thermal throttling

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is it safe to manually control my Mac's fans?**  
A: Yes, as long as you keep fans running at reasonable speeds. ffan enforces minimum speeds and monitors temperatures. If you're unsure, use Automatic mode.

**Q: Will this void my warranty?**  
A: No. You're only adjusting existing hardware controls, not modifying hardware or firmware.

**Q: Why does fan control need root access?**  
A: macOS protects SMC write operations in the kernel. This is a security feature to prevent malicious software from damaging hardware.

**Q: Can I use this on a MacBook?**  
A: Yes! ffan works on both MacBooks and desktop Macs. Consider battery impact when running fans at high speeds.

**Q: My temperatures aren't shown correctly.**  
A: Try these sensors: TC0P, TC0D, TC0E. Different Mac models use different sensor keys. Check the SystemMonitor code to add your model's sensors.

**Q: Does this work on Linux or Windows?**  
A: No, ffan is macOS-only due to SMC being Apple-specific hardware.
